      To keep morale high, I made a concerted effort to recognize and celebrate small wins along the way. Whether it was overcoming a particularly challenging technical hurdle or meeting a critical milestone ahead of schedule, I      made sure to acknowledge the team's efforts and contributions.

      Additionally, I encouraged a collaborative environment where team members felt comfortable sharing ideas and supporting one another. By fostering a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose, we were able to navigate              through       the challenges together.
