# Behavioral Questions

Key behavioral questions to prepare for FAANG+ interviews focus on leadership, teamwork, communication, adaptability, integrity, and ownership. Interviewers want to see how candidates handle conflict, take initiative, collaborate, overcome challenges, and learn from mistakes. Using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure answers is crucial for clarity and impact.

Common behavioral questions include:
- Tell me about yourself.
- Why do you want to work here?
- Describe a time you led a project.
- Give an example of resolving a conflict.
- Tell me about a failure or mistake and what you learned.
- Describe a time you adapted to change.
- How do you handle missed deadlines?
- What is your biggest achievement?
- Give an example of taking ownership of a problem.
- Tell me about a time you worked in a team to solve a complex problem.

FAANG companies value evidence of owning outcomes, influencing without authority, effective communication, and demonstrating problem-solving skills through real work stories. Candidates should refine stories with measurable results and practice delivering them confidently to fit the companyâ€™s core values.[3][7][9]
